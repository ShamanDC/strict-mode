***Strict Mode Tester

This is the source companion to my [blog post](http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/03/javascript-strict-mode/)

I've written a test for all ES 5 38 Strict Mode features as defined [here](http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Annex_C)

For the visual test page open `test.html` in your browser. (You can also run the hosted version [here](http://java-script.limewebs.com/strictMode/test_hosted.html)).

The file `tests.js` can also be dumped into your developer console - just switch mode to CONSOLE_MODE
