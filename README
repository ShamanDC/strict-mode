This is the source companion to my article http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/03/javascript-strict-mode/

I've written a test for all ES 5 38 Strict Mode features as defined here
http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Annex_C

For the visual test page open test.html in your browser (you can also click on http://java-script.limewebs.com/strictMode/test_hosted.html to run the hosted version)

The file tests.js can also be dumped into your developer console - just switch mode to CONSOLE_MODE  

(Note that browser echoing is pulled from a utility at https://github.com/angus-c/assortedLameness/blob/master/browser/echoBrowser.js)
