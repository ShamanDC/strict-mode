This is the source companion to my article "JavaScript Strict Mode" http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/01/javascript-strict-mode/

I've written a test for all ES 5 38 Strict Mode features as defined here
http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Annex_C

For the visual test page open tests.html in your browser (you can also click on file:///Users/angus/workspace/github/strictMode/src/test.html to run the hosted version)

The file tests.js can also be dumped into your developer console - just switch mode to CONSOLE_MODE
